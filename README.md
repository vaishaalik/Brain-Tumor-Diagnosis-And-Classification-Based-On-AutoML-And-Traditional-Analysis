# BrainTumorDetectionUsingML-DL
Trial1:<br>
Implementation of CNN without any preprocessing on images
<br>
Trial2:<br>
Used pytorch for preprocessing,applied resnet18 model.
<br>
At epoch 122 we get the highest testing accuracy of 78.502%.
<br>
Trial4:<br>
has the lr,knn,svm,cnn and vgg 16 models
<br>

ConfusionMatrices:<br>
Contains final results of all 7 models with original and pre-processed images.
