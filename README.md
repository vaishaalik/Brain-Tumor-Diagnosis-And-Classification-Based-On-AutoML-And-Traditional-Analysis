# Brain Tumor Diagnosis And Classification Based On AutoML And Traditional Analysis
Trial1:<br>
Implementation of CNN without any preprocessing on images
<br>

Trial2:<br>
Used pytorch for preprocessing,applied resnet18 model.
<br>

Trial3:<br>
Running the CNN model again by tweaking some parameters.
<br>

Trial4:<br>
This folder contains the lr,knn,svm,cnn and transfer learning models.
<br>

Trial5:<br>
This folder contains the final vgg16 model used for classification in this project.
<br>

ConfusionMatrices:<br>
Contains final results of all 7 models with original and pre-processed images.
<br>

Pre-processing Code:<br>
Contains the code for all the pre-processing methods experimented with in this project.
The image below presents the results obtained from applying the pre-processing methods on the original image.
